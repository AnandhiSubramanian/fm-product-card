## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. css flexbox
2. Adding google fonts to the webpage
3. Border radius seems to be not working as the child div's overflow gives impression that border radius is not working

{
border-radius: px;
overflow: hidden
}

4. Css styles inside media queries where not working
   The generic styling should always be above the media query definition. So always add media queries at the bottom.
